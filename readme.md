event-hub-client
========

Simple Azure EventHub Client.  Uses REST API for Create/Send operations, trying to use AMQP once I can get it working.

## Usage


    function demonstrateEventHubSend() {
    }

    function demonstrateEventHubReceive() {
    }

## Caveats

* So far, can't get AMQP up and running.  I've tried the ```amqp``` and ```amqplib``` modules.

## Installation

Installs via *npm*:

```
npm install event-hub-client
```
